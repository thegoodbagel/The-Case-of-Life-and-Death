    Something groundbreaking happened on June 24, 2022. Something that would forever change the fate of women in
    America.
  </h3>

  <p class="small_text">
    52 years ago, under the anonymous guise "Jane Roe", a pregnant woman filed a lawsuit for legalizing abortion in Texas. After
    three years at court, the US Supreme court reached a landmark decision. In 1973, abortion became legalized nationwide. This historic case was known as <em>Roe v. Wade</em> . On Friday, the
    Supreme court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Individual states are now permitted to re-ban abortion&mdash;and they
    will.

        <strong> How has abortion played out in history? </strong> <br>
      </p>
      <p class="small_text">
        The earliest documented abortions took place in Egypt at aroun 1550 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, abortion
        was an extensive practice that likely went unpunished. Throughout the most of Western history, abortion was not
        criminalized as long as it carried out before a stage called "quickening", when women could feel the first
        movements of the fetus, roughly 3-5 months.
      </p>

      <p class="small_text">
        A shift came about in the 19th century, when public opinion began to turn against abortion. The primary factors
        were that physics were arguing that conception began before quickening and that abortion providers were often
        untrained, unprofessional doctors. Thus started the emergence of anti-abortion laws.
      </p>

      <p class="small_text">
        In 1821, the first anti-abortion law took place in Connecticut, which punished the providers of
        abortion-inducing substances. In 1845, New York passed a law that punished abortion receivers with a prison
        sentence. By the 1910, every state in the US had some form of abortion restriction policies.
      </p>

      <p class="small_text">
        However, in the 1960s, abortion laws took a turn again, this time towards liberalization. A number of
        pro-abortion organizations were formed, including the Society for Humane Abortion and the NARAL Pro-Choice
        America.

        <strong> What was <em>Roe v.</em> Wade and what did the overturn do&mdash;or undo? </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="small_text">
        In 1973, the landmark judgement of the Supreme Court in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> legalized abortion across the
        nation. In 1992, the <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> case reaffirmed <em>Roe v. Wade</em> while loosening
        the framework for state policies on abortion.
      </p>

      <p class="small_text">
        Following the 2010 midterm elections, state restrictions on abortion took a sharp turn due to an increase of the
        Republican party. The types of bans included ultrasound laws, criminalization of abortions based on the sex or
        race of a fetus, fetal abnormality laws, "fetal heartbeat" laws, trigger laws that would go into place if
        <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was overturned, and much more.

      <p class="small_text">
        On Jun 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> asserting that</a> "the
        Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; <em>Roe</em> and <em>Casey</em> are overruled; and the
        authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives".

        Without constitutional coverance, states are now free to apply their own regulations on abortions.
      </p>
      <p class="small_text">
        According to the Guttmacher Institute, "26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion". <a target="_blank"

        Additionally, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">New York Times</a> explains
        that "in many cases, courts still must determine the fate of these restrictions. Lawmakers in other states are
        expected to propose new laws either to restrict or to protect abortion access."
